# IA-Project
This is the repository where I will keep the A.I project for university.
## external libs
  - **SFML** :https://www.sfml-dev.org/
## How to use
 1. this project needs you to build the sfml library (preferably using cmake). 
 2. Have a environment variable called 'DEVLIBS'(could be anything really thats just the one I use),which should go to wherever you keep your c++ library 
	- your route to the .lib file should look like this *(DEVLIBS)SFML\lib\(x64 or x86)\(Debug or Release)*
 3. place the dlls in the same place where the .exe is located.
Now the project should work.
